# AppliedRegression

## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to provide the R code to the examples, assignments, and take
home exams that are covered in UNO's ISQA 8340 Applied Regression class.  The class is taught
using the IBM software application SPSS while following the course textbook (listed below).  

Since the ISQA college is a technical college some students may find it more interesting to
work through the coursework in the R statistical programming language to better prepare them
for data analytics positions in the workforce.  I began working through the examples and about
half way through the course so a lot of the early material is missing and, it may be worthwhile
for future students to contribute to this repo for completeness.  

##Course Textbook
