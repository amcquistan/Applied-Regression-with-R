# AppliedRegression with R

![alt tag](R.png)

## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to provide the R code to the examples, assignments, and take
home exams that are covered in UNO's ISQA 8340 Applied Regression class.  The class is taught
using the IBM software application SPSS while following the course textbook (listed below).  

Since the ISQA college is a technical college some students may find it more interesting to
work through the coursework in the R statistical programming language to better prepare them
for data analytics positions in the workforce.  I began working through the examples and about
half way through the course so a lot of the early material is missing and, it may be worthwhile
for future students to contribute to this repo for completeness.  

## How to Use this Code and Data

In most of the folders you will find a few different types of files:
1. R Markdowm files with .Rmd extension that contain the R code and Latex markup. 
   For more info on how R Markdown works please visit https://www.rstudio.com/ for more info
2. PDF files which are the product of the execution of the R Markdown files
3. CSV data files.  I was not as structured as I would have likes to be. Sometimes they are in 
   a folder and other times not.  Sometimes they are in the raw form from the textbook and other
   times they are a bit more cleaned up.  However, either way the code describes how to ingest them.
