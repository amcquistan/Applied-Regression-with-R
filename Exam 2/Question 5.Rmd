#Problem 5 - Do Problems 7.8 and 7.10 on page 290
* Hierarchical Regression (Blocks) should be used
* Partial coefficients of determination can be found using either Hierarchical or correlates of SPSS

##Problem 7.8 - Refer to the realestate data from the previous problem.  Test whether X2 and X3 can be dropped from the regression model given X1 and X4 are retained. Use $\alpha = 0.01$ What is the p-value and the decision rules.

##Test whether multiple $\beta_K=0$

Test whether both X2 and X3 should be removed from the model

$H_0: \beta_2 = \beta_3 = 0$

$H_a$: not both $\beta_2$ and $\beta_3$ equal zero

Do a simple anova test of reduced against full model and assess partial F test
to test whether at $\alpha = 0.01$ the models are different. Note that a new p-value is needed because R's default uses $\alpha = 0.05$

```{r}
setwd("C:\\Users\\AdamMcQuistan\\Documents\\ISQA 8340\\Exam 2")
df <- read.csv("data/6.18.csv")
names(df)[2:6] = c("Y", "X1", "X2", "X3", "X4")

full <- lm(Y ~ X1 + X4 + X2 + X3, data=df)
reduced <- lm(Y ~ X1 + X4, data=df)
aov_result <- anova(reduced, full)
F_stat <- aov_result$F[2]
F_crit <- qf(0.99, aov_result$Df[2], aov_result$Res.Df[2])
p_val <- 1-pf(q=F_stat, 2, aov_result$Res.Df[1])
conclusion <- ifelse(F_stat <= F_crit, "Conclude Null Hypthosis", "Reject Null Hypthosis")
cat("F* =", F_stat, ", F crit (0.99,",  aov_result$Df[2], 
    ",",  aov_result$Res.Df[2], ") =", F_crit, "\n", conclusion,", Pvalue = ", p_val, sep=" ")
```
